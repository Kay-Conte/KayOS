### About this project

This project is an attempt to build an operating system from the ground up with no external dependencies. The project will be written in assembly and C.

## Current goals

I don't have any hardset goals yet, though I would at some point like a fully functioning "complete" gui based operating system with a programming language of my own to pair with it.

## What is done so far

In this commit, I am currently working on the bootloader. Nothing has been done yet other than a lot of reading and a bit of procrastinating as I've had a lack of free-time.

## How to build and run

### Requirements
    - Must have nasm installed

### Compilation
    - run the build script in /build/build.sh or use nasm to compile yourself

### Running
    - run with qemu using the run script in /build/run.sh or run with qemu yourself
    - Has not been tested on real hardware yet though you may try and share the results with me if you wish

## Contributions

Any information you may think is relevant to my project I will gladly accept. Code contributions should be talked about before hand though are unlikely to be accepted unless we are working hand in hand. This is my personal project and I wish to build it from the ground up.

When this project comes to a usable state, contributions can be done likely either in a seperate repository, or organization for individual programs made for the system
